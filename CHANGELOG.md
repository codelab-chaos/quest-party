## Unreleased

### Added

- Progress is now shared over the channel you choose, as addon messages that never show in chat: your quests, objectives, levels, discoveries, professions and achievements reach everyone on the same channel who runs Quest Party, and theirs show in your feed and as their quest cards.
- The player list shows who is sharing on the channel, and says when someone joins or leaves.
- `/qp share` reports what has been sent, how much of it came back from the server, what was received, and whether the game refused anything.
- In debug mode, the sample party emulator sends its players over the channel and shows them only when the server sends them back, and `/qp listen` opens a window listing the messages on the channel as they pass.

### Fixed

- A character with a surname is recognized as itself, so its own messages are not mistaken for another player's.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-11-13

### Fixed

- Improved quest identification, including quests accepted before Quest Party started tracking them.
- Repaired saved "Unknown quest" objectives when they can be matched to your own quest log.
- Quest item counts now update the existing objective line as counts increase or decrease.
- Removed duplicate objective lines left by older builds and corrected total quest progress.
